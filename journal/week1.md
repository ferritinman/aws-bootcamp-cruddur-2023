# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

## Required Homework/Tasks

### Containerize Application (Dockerfiles, Docker Compose)

- Created a [Dockerfile](../backend-flask/Dockerfile) in ./backend-flask and a [Dockerfile](../frontend-react-js/Dockerfile) ./frontend-reactjs to create docker images.

- Created a [docker-compose.yml](../docker-compose.yml) file in the main directory to be able to define and run multi-container applications (Flask, ReactJS, Postgres and DynamoDB)

### Document the Notification Endpoint for the OpenAI Document

- Briefly went over the [OpenAPI Specifications](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest.html) documentation  

- Updated [openapi-3.0.yml](../backend-flask/openapi-3.0.yml) to add a new notifications endpoint

### Write a Flask Backend Endpoint for Notifications

- Created a notification endpoint by:
    - Creating [notification_activities](../backend-flask/services/notifications_activities.py) 
    - Updating [app.py](../backend-flask/app.py)

### Write a React Page for Notifications

- Fixed up the notificaton page by:
    - Creating [NotificationsFeedPage.css](../frontend-react-js/src/pages/NotificationsFeedPage.css)
    - Creating [NotificationsFeedPage.js](../frontend-react-js/src/pages/NotificationsFeedPage.js)
    - Updating [App.js](../frontend-react-js/src/App.js)

### Run DynamoDB Local Container and ensure it works

- Made appropriate changes to the [docker-compose.yml](../docker-compose.yml) using a prebuilt image ([amazon/dynamodb-local](https://hub.docker.com/r/amazon/dynamodb-local))
- Ran "docker compose up" and tested it with examples from [100 Days of Cloud](https://github.com/100DaysOfCloud/challenge-dynamodb-local)

### Run Postgres Container and ensure it works

- Made appropriate changes to the [docker-compose.yml](../docker-compose.yml) using a prebuilt image ([postgres](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres))
- Ran "docker compose up" and tested it connecting via psql

```bash
$ psql -U postgres -h localhost postgres
```


## Homework Challenges

### Run the dockerfile CMD as an external script

- Created a simple file called Dockerfile.date (it's not the default name but it's easier for me to distinguish for homework challenges)

- Unfortunately, I was unable to make "banner" print my username without the space.  It's just a limitation I will have to live with.

- I'm not exactly sure how I installed a version of docker build with build kit (hence, the buildx), so I read up on it a bit. [BuildKit](https://docs.docker.com/build/buildkit/)

### Push and tag a image to DockerHub (they have a free tier)

- I already had a previous DockerHub account from long ago.  This was pretty straight forward

```
$ docker login --username victorlouiedev

$ docker image ls
REPOSITORY   TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED        SIZE
date         latest    c651c9018a0c   8 months ago   101MB

$ docker tag c651c9018a0c victorlouiedev/date:1.0.0

$ docker image ls
REPOSITORY            TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED        SIZE
date                  latest    c651c9018a0c   8 months ago   101MB
victorlouiedev/date   1.0.0     c651c9018a0c   8 months ago   101MB

$ docker push victorlouiedev/date:1.0.0
```

### Use multi-stage building for a Dockerfile build

### Implement a healthcheck in the V3 Docker compose file

### Research best practices of Dockerfiles and attempt to implement it in your Dockerfile

- I followed the instructions from [Run the Docker daemon as a non-root user](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/) for Ubuntu.

- I made a mistake by not installing uidmap but the install script caught it
```bash
victor@professorchaos:/usr/bin$ ./dockerd-rootless-setuptool.sh install
[ERROR] Missing system requirements. Run the following commands to
[ERROR] install the requirements and run this tool again.

########## BEGIN ##########
sudo sh -eux <<EOF
# Install newuidmap & newgidmap binaries
apt-get install -y uidmap
EOF
########## END ##########
```

### Learn how to install Docker on your localmachine and get the same containers running outside of Gitpod / Codespaces

- Docker was installed last week on my Ubuntu box.  I ran the steps for running it as a Docker daemon as a non-root user above.  If you look at the systemctl calls, you can see the original one is not running.

### Launch an EC2 instance that has docker installed, and pull a container to demonstrate you can run your own docker processes.
