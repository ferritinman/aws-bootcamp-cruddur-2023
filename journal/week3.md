# Week 3 â€” Decentralized Authentication

## Required Homework/Tasks

### Setup Cognito User Pool

I got the opportunity to setup the Cognito User Pools 4x. It was good practice.

### Implement Custom Signin Page

The following is CLI command to remove the "Force change password" state on the "Confirmation status" of manually created users in AWS Cognito

``` bash
 $  aws cognito-idp admin-set-user-password --username victor --password PASSWORD_XYZ --user-pool-id ca-central-1_X5TwbcOqa --permanent
 ```

### Implement Custom Signup Page

No issues with this task as I was following along with the video.

### Implement Custom Confirmation Page

No issues with this task as I was following along with the video.

### Implement Custom Recovery Page

No issues with this task as I was following along with the video.

### Implement backend Flask with JWT (video not on watch list)

This gave me a good start on understanding some of the magic JWT token stuff at work. It really helped pulling that code out of the library.  My code could be cleaned up a bit.  I deviated a little bit but the code does work.  I'll have to look into Flask/Python best practices because it feels like I'm hacking code.

### Watch about different approaches to verifying JWTs

I watched the video about architecting the application with differing levels of coupling/decoupling the Flask application and JWT service.

I've been having trouble with running docker compose up with GitPod.  Not exactly sure what is going on.

Update 2023-03-10 - Gitpod seems to have fixed itself

## Homework Challenges

I am starting to run out of credits for GitPod, troubleshooting the issue above so I've decided to shelve any GitPod development this week. 

I did try to run docker compose locally but didn't get it completely working.  There is something that got installed that found some errors in my js code that I had to fix from this  [checkin](https://github.com/ferritinman/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/commit/ad20c66445fc464a1ce794406e63d5f476e1b63e)

Not sure if it counts, but I followed your video and fixed the CSS for better contrasts in the UI.

I did some research on the "Sidecar" design pattern on [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/sidecar](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/sidecar)
