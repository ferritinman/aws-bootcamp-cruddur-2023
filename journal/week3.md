# Week 3 â€” Decentralized Authentication

## Required Homework/Tasks

## Setup Cognito User Pool

I got the opportunity to setup the Cognito User Pools 4x. It was good practice.

### Implement Custom Signin Page

The following is CLI command to remove the "Force change password" state on the "Confirmation status" of manually created users in AWS Cognito

``` bash
 $  aws cognito-idp admin-set-user-password --username victor --password PASSWORD_XYZ --user-pool-id ca-central-1_X5TwbcOqa --permanent
 ```

### Implement Custom Signup Page

No issues with this task as I was following the video.

### Implement Custom Confirmation Page

No issues with this task as I was following the video.

### Implement Custom Recovery Page

No issues with this task as I was following the video.

### Implement backend Flask with JWT (video not on watch list)

No issues with this task as I was following the video.

### Watch about different approaches to verifying JWTs

I watched a video about varying levels of architecting the application with differing levels of coupling/decoupling the Flask application and JWT service.

I've been having trouble with running docker compose up with GitPod.  Not exactly sure what is going on.
